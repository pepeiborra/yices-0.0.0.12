	into multiple lines rather than one line.

	* Math/SMT/Yices/Syntax.hs: Avoided quadratic complexity in the pretty
	printer and fixed a bug in the pretty printer
	* Math/SMT/Yices/Pipe.hs (checkY) : display Yices errors and extraneous
	output handling of "unknown" answers
	* Math/SMT/Yices/Pipe.hs (quickCheckY, quickCheckY') : Added a driver
	which does not use the yices interactive prompt.
	The interactive prompt has problems parsing large expressions,
	as warned in the Yices FAQ.
